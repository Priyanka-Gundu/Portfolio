Dashboard Overview
This Power BI report is designed for the Woolworths sales team to monitor its loyalty program performance. It provides insights into customer registrations, transactions, points activity, and store-level contributions, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance customer engagement.

Customer Growth and Transactions
In CY23, 1,000 new customers registered and 5,508 transactions were recorded. While the absolute numbers show program interest, further analysis is needed to determine if these figures meet Woolworths performance benchmarks.
Points Earned vs. Redeemed
Customers earned 874K points, but only 42K points were redeemed - about 5% of the total points. This low redemption rate suggests potential to drive higher engagement by encouraging customers to utilize their rewards more actively.
Transaction Value
The AUD 876K in transaction value demonstrates strong monetary engagement from loyalty members.
Monitoring this figure over time can help assess the impact of loyalty incentives on overall spend.
Store Performance
The top 5 stores (Parramatta, Campbelltown, Blacktown, Bondi, and Hornsby) contribute approximately 80% of all points earned. This concentration of activity indicates these locations are key drivers of loyalty engagement and could serve as models for boosting performance in other regions.
Membership Status & Redemption Types
The pie chart (Customer Membership Status) reveals distribution across different loyalty tiers - helpful for tailoring rewards and communications.
Points redeemed by type offers clues about which reward categories drive the most redemptions, informing future reward strategies.
Trends Over Time
Line charts illustrating customer registrations and points earned vs. redeemed reveal patterns - such as spikes in enrollment or redemption - often linked to marketing initiatives or seasonal factors.
Tracking these trends helps in refining promotional timing and optimizing loyalty offers.

Key Recommendations
